# Paris 2024 Olympics Data Analysis & Visualization

# Project Overview

This project explores the Paris 2024 Olympics dataset to uncover insights into athlete performance, medal distribution, and country-wise participation. Using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization, the project highlights patterns in age distribution, gender participation, and medal counts.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills: from data extraction and cleaning to advanced querying and creating interactive dashboards for storytelling.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing Olympic-related information, including:

athletes.csv – athlete details (name, gender, age, sport, country)
coaches.csv – coach assignments
events.csv – list of Olympic events
medals.csv – medal distribution by athlete and event
medals_total.csv – total medal counts by country
schedule.csv / schedule_preliminary.csv – match and event schedules
teams.csv – team participation details
results.csv – event outcomes
venues.csv – venue details for competitions

Tools & Technologies

SQL (SQLite DB Browser) – for querying and data analysis

Tableau – for visualization and dashboard creation

Python (optional step) – for additional data cleaning or exploration

Analysis Performed

Athlete Age Distribution – average age across sports and countries

Medal Counts by Country – gold, silver, bronze tallies

Gender-based Performance Comparison – participation and medal trends

Event & Venue Insights – identifying top-performing sports and countries

Time-based Trends – event schedules and medal progression

📊 Visualizations

The analysis was visualized in Tableau dashboards, including:

🌍 World Map – medal distribution by country

🥇 Bar Charts – top-performing nations by medal counts

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Pie Charts – gender participation comparison

📈 Interactive Dashboards – combining filters and drill-downs for deeper insights
